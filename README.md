# Trybe futebol clube

## A website to view football match information
## In this project I built an API on the backend, that feeds the frontend, and the integration tests for it. The rest was given by [trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/).

### Main skills used:
* Typescript
* Express
* Node.js

### Instaling dependencies
run at the root of the project
```
npm install
```

### Running the program in docker localy using docker compose
Go to the **app** folder and run the following
```
npm run compose:up
```
> The application uses ports 3000, 3001 and 3002 for the frontend, backend and database respectively

> To stop the compose run: **npm run compose:down**
